#BY USING THIS SCRIPT WE CAN ORGANIZE THE FILES BY FOLLOWING METHODS:

extension wise(.mp3, .mp4, .mkv, etc),
nested folder structure (Year->Month->Week), etc.

STEP 1: IMPORTING MODULES OS AND SHUTIL

STEP 2: CREATING USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS FOR THE ABOVE METHODS 
         for eg: TO ORGANIZE BY FILE CATEGORY MAKE UDF LIKE category()
         
STEP 3:GET PATH INPUTS SOURCE AND DESTINATON
        SOURCE PATH: THE CURRENT FOLDER HAVING 100S OF FILES
        DESTINATION PATH: THE FOLDER IN WHICH WE WANT TO MOVE FILES 
                          ->IF WE WANT TO GET ORGANIZED FILES IN THE SAME FOLDER THEN GIVE THE SAME PATH AS SOURCE PATH
                          
STEP 4: GET
